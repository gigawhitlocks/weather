* Weather API Experiment Junkyard

This repository holds remnants of an old Weather Underground integration for RocketChat and at least one usable module.

** ROADMAP

I tend to play with a lot of weather APIs and data and I will continue to use this repository to hold libraries I write in Go related to that goal. +I am looking into writing a DarkSky module and something to solve the geocoding problem.+

** WORKING

The ~nws/~ folder holds an ~nws~ module that can be used for querying the National Weather Service for current conditions. This was my first iteration before adopting the Wunderground API and it still works. It can be imported as ~github.com/gigawhitlocks/weather/nws~ and is usable.

The ~gfs/~ folder might hold some code that can assemble gifs from images on tropicaltidbits.com but I haven't dug in to see what still works.

~geocoding~ provides a library backed by the [[https://opencagedata.com/api][OpenCageData API]]

~climacell~ provides a package backed by the [[https://climacell.co][ClimaCell]] API aimed for use with my Mattermost weather plugin. It might not be very general.

** REMOVED

The Wunderground API was shut down in late 2018 and the core functionality of this plugin stopped working. I have also stopped using RocketChat. Thus, the parts of the repository supporting RocketChat and Wunderground have been removed.

** ARCHIVED

I have saved some screenshots of the old behavior below, for posterity. This repository will no longer be used for chat-related functionality, and will instead contain only weather-related functionality. [[https://github.com/gigawhitlocks/mattermost-national-weather-service-plugin][The chatbot-like features have been moved to a Mattermost plugin]].
